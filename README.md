🚀 Excited to share my latest project, combining cutting-edge technologies like Langchain, LLM, Streamlit, and Vector Databases to simplify the job application process! 🚀

🌟 Project Highlight: I've developed an Email Generator that crafts personalized job application emails seamlessly! Here's how it works:

📁 CSV Input: I create a CSV with my team's skills & portfolio links.
🧠 Vector Database: Store the CSV data in a Vector Database for fast retrieval.
🌐 Job Scraping: Provide the URL of a job posting, and my program will scrape and extract key skills required.
⚡ Skills Matching: The program matches the extracted skills with my team's portfolio stored in the vector database.
✉️ AI-Powered Email: Using llama-70B, it generates a tailored email for the job posting! 🎯
This project showcases my expertise in Langchain, LLM, Streamlit, and Vector Databases, pushing the boundaries of automation and AI in job applications. 💻🔥
